***************
### This file is the manual of muon scattering tomography of objects that uses musrSim to do simulation.
And PoCA algorithm is used to analyze the track information and get the imaging results.

The simulation and analysis used the SJTU/INPAC cluster.
For another server cluster, it needs to modify it.
###

###
The software used in simulation and analysis:

Geant4 version: 10.7.2
ROOT Version: 6.24/06
Python 3.9.6
###



***************
The files are divided into 2 parts: (1) tomography simulation and (2) imaging analysis.

###
(1) Tomography simulation:
Purpose: To get muon position information and momentum information after muon tomography; 

"TDLI_Imaging.mac": An example script for object design used in "musrSim";

"run-scan.sh": The command script that uses executable file to do simulation and use analysis file to store useful information.

"Submit.condor": Submit the command to INPAC cluster;

#"visVRML.mac": The file for visualization of imaging object and detector;

"particleTreeAna/ana": The analysis file;

"logs": To record simulation process;

"data": The folder for simulation results and analysis results;


(2) imaging analysis:
Purpose: To show the imaging results by using PoCA algorithm;
Python version;

"Analysis":

PoCA_Algorithm: The self-defined functions for imaging using PoCA algorithm;

Imaging-Results: The file that shows the imaging results using PoCA algorithm;
